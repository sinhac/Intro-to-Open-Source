## Four Criteria for Free Software
1. run program for any purpose
2. can access and study source code 
3. can redistribute/modify copies freely
4. can redistribute derived works

## Why it's Important to Choose a License
First off, a license grants permission to (someone or something) to use something or to allow an activity to take place. Having an open source license gives permission to follow the four criteria for free software (for distribution). Different licenses give different permissions so it is important to choose a license that fits the purpose of what you're trying to do. Licenses are important because the license protects the degree of freedom you want your software to have. Making software open source also helps reduce monopolies?

## Why Only Projects With Explicit Licenses Should be Used
Projects with explicit licenses should be used so that the exact terms of using that software is known. You're guaranteed to get software that meets both the conditions/criteria of free and open source software depending on the license. a.k.a. the creator of code that you use can't come back and bite you if you're allowed to use it under their license.

## Failure to Follow the Open System Model Section
I guess I agree although it's a super open source mindset. I get how giving the software out to the public early (without taking extensive care in getting it just right) obtains a larger population using that software, and the problems are fixed along the way with more developers working on it because they have the incentive to. So I see how Web beat Gopher. Kind of.

## Justification of Why Linux uses GPL v2 license
The same or more restrictive copyright must be used. The copyleft part of it only applies when the program is going to be redistributed and only to the software. This way the open source nature of Linux is preserved.

## Example Project
I like WordPress's choice to use the GPL (V2 or V3) license because people who add to the code (in a good way) are forced to make it share-able (it's a bit stricter than the MIT and Apache Licenses).

## License Matching
For a developer: The GPL/LGPL licenses are good for a developer (if the developer does not work for a company) because the developer can integrate and use other programs. The best license truly depends on what the developer wants.

For a company: Using the Apache license is best for a company because the apache license does not have to disclose source, include original, states changes, or include install instructions, and can sublicense; however, the apache license can't use a trademark.

For the common good: Both the GPL and LGPL can place warranties and use patent claims, neither can sublicense, and both must include the original, state changes, disclose source, and include install instructions. Using an LGPL license is best because the derivative work must make the source available under the same terms.

## Newly Created Repository
Named my repository the-cookie-clique and I selected the Apache license for it.

## This Course's Project
I'm thinking about writing a fitbit app because I want to do something health related on a device I've seen many people use. I'm not sure exactly what I want to track or do yet but I'm leaning toward something involving sleep cycles. The users/customers will be comprised of Fitbit owners. I want to use a license that allows other people to be able to expand my program, so perhaps...a GPL?
