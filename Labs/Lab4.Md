One important, but often overlooked, contribution to Open Source Software is documentation - it spans a wide variety of written words: from manual pages to FAQs to handbooks to websites.

The value of good documentation cannot be understated, and there are always fixes to be made. It allows users and developers alike to get software running correctly and quickly, reduces frustration, gets new users excited for the software, and enhances programming effort.

Documentation is one of the hallmarks of the positive feedback loop in Open Source Software.

*Good documentation enables good code. Good code enables good documentation.*

This lab will result in creating a patch that you can send to an Open Source project for inclusion. You will be fixing a minor documentation bug, such as a typo.

We will be using two projects, each known for their high quality and care for good documentation: **FreeBSD** and **OpenBSD**. You may choose which project's documentation to work with for this assignment.

It is highly recommended that if you are using Windows you install Cygwin or install a *BSD or Linux in a virtual machine for this lab.

## [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org)
FreeBSD's documentation can be found [here](https://www.freebsd.org/docs.html)

The primary documents are the [Handbook](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/) and the [man pages](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi).

The Handbook is quite large, and covers every aspect of the system. The manual pages also describe the system, but from a different perspective. There are also smaller handbooks, such as the [Developer's Handbook](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-handbook/) and the [Porter's Handbook](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook/)

## [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org)
OpenBSD's primary documentation is the [FAQ](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/index.html)

Additionally, there is the [Porter's Handbook](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/ports/index.html) and the [manual pages](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi).

*One important note: OpenBSD prefers British spelling over American spelling (FreeBSD prefers American spelling).*

# Now the Problem

Documentation like code needs to be constantly updated to stay relevant. Additionally, just like code, mistakes are made. Your goal is to read through as much documentation as you need to in order to discover a bug (the BSDs consider all documentation errors bugs as important and serious as code mistakes).

* Any web page for either project that you go to is also fair game for this lab. One thing that can be done for websites besides looking for typos is to click on all the links and make sure they go to the site they say they will (or if they go to a website at all).

* Browsing the manual pages is best if you have a familiarity with Unix. Here is an [incomplete list of Unix commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unix_commands) to get started.

* Also, here is a description of [how to navigate the manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page#Manual_sections). Each numbered section of the manual also has a page named intro, which you can use to start browsing.

Remember, for this assignment you are not necessarily reading for correctness of documentation (unless you know enough about a particular topic to do so), you are reading for spelling and grammar.

## If you choose FreeBSD:

You will need a subversion client. Most Linux distros and all BSDs have subversion in their package repositories. Windows users should use Cygwin or a *BSD or Linux virtual machine.

* The first thing you will want to do is identify the documentation fix first, before you check out any code. Unlike git, subversion allows you to check out only the parts of the tree that you need. You only need to checkout the module that your fix will be in, so there is no need to grab the entire FreeBSD source tree.

* Once you have identified what you will fix, you can then grab it. You do so by looking through [FreeBSD's source tree](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/) and locating the directory the file you want to edit is in.
    * Manual pages are located in the base/ directory, everything else is located in the doc/ directory.

* Once you have found your file, you can check out the module it is in by issuing the following command:
```
    $ svn checkout https://svn0.us-west.FreeBSD.org/base/head localdirectory/
```

This example will checkout the base source tree to a directory on your computer named `localdirectory`. You are responsible for editing the part of the command from “base” onward, to select which module you want to check out and where you want it to be on your hard drive. Be aware that you may check out the doc module instead of the base module.

> You may need to double check that you are checking out the right part of the repository.

* Next, use your favorite text editor to make the fix.

* You then need to generate a diff that can be checked in by a committer. To do so on Unix, run:
```
    $ svn diff filename > myfix.diff
```
You can name myfix.diff anything you want, but it is best if it ends in .diff or .patch. You can now look at your diff to make sure it is correct.

* If it is, you are ready to send your fix to FreeBSD.
    * To report the bug fix, go to their [support website](https://www.freebsd.org/support.html).  (You will need to create an account on their bugzilla, it's free.)

## If you choose OpenBSD:

You will need a cvs client. Most Linuxes and FreeBSD have cvs in their package repositories. OpenBSD and NetBSD have cvs in their base install, so if you are using either of these, you need not install any software. Windows users should use Cygwin or a *BSD or Linux virtual machine.

* The first thing you will want to do is identify the documentation fix first, before you check out any code. Unlike git, cvs permits checking out only the directories you want to do work in, so there is no need to grab the entire OpenBSD source tree.

* Once you have identified what you will fix, you can then grab it. You do so by looking through [OpenBSD's source tree](http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/) and locating the directory the file you want to edit is in. Manual pages are located in the src/ directory, everything else is located in the www/ directory.

* Once you have found your file, you can check out its directory by issuing the following command:
```
    $ cvs -danoncvs@openbsd.nycbug.org:/cvs checkout -P www/faq
```
This example will checkout the OpenBSD FAQ web pages to a directory on your computer named www/faq. You are responsible for editing only the last part of the command (“www/faq”) to identify which directory of the tree you want to check out.

* Next, use your favorite text editor to make the fix.

* You then need to generate a diff that can be checked in by a developer. To do so on Unix, run:
```
    $ cvs diff -uNp filename > myfix.diff
```
You can name myfix.diff anything you want, but it is best if it ends in .diff or .patch. You can now look at your diff to make sure it is correct.

* If it is, you are ready to send your fix to OpenBSD. OpenBSD accepts documentation patches to their <tech@openbsd.org> mailing list. Diffs must be sent inline (that is, the body of the email must itself be your diff). It is also preferable if you add some information about the diff in the email, so you will want put one or two blank lines at the very top, and add that information.

    Here are some examples of documentation diffs sent to OpenBSD to give you a feel for how they should look:

# Wrapping up (both FreeBSD and OpenBSD):

Now that your diff is submitted, you may be asked to provide more information over the coming days. Don't forget to answer any inquiries, this helps make sure your diff is correct and in shape to be committed.

If everything checks out, you should see your name in the FreeBSD or OpenBSD commit logs soon.

*Make sure you write up in a lab report (as  markdown file in your github page)  about what you changed, why it is important to maintain good documentation, and what you have learned from this lab. 

*Also add the diff you submitted and a link to your commit request email in your blog post*
