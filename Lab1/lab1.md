### Importance of 10 Open Source Criteria
 1. Free Redistribution: no longer considered "open" if giving software away requires a royaltee or fee
 2. Source Code: if the source code isn't shared, it will be hard to make the project maintainable because other people won't have access to it
 3. Derived Works: changes can be made to original software
 4. Integrity of the Author's Source Code: not sure why this one's important
 5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups: otherwise the software isn't available to everyone, which it should be in order to be open source
 6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor: the fact that the code can be used for any purpose makes it open source
 7. Distribution of License: so the software can be redistributed repeatedly, without diminishing rights each time
 8. License Must Not be Specific to a Product: if it is and the product is not open source, the licensed software must still be usable as if it weren't attached to the product
 9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software: not sure why this is important
 10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral: if the license only works for an individual technology, the software won't be open source because it excludes people who use other technologies

### How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way
 The list pretty much covers it. I would add upvoting good answers that work instead of just repeating the answer or not upvoting at all.
 Can't think of anything else except for agreeing with/stressing answering the actual question.

I'm thinking about writing a fitbit app because I want to do something health related on a device I've seen many people use. I'm not sure exactly what I want to track or do yet but I'm leaning toward something involving sleep cycles. I need to first look at the API's needed to write this app. After I learn some of the language and see that I have the resources needed, I can figure out the exact purpose of the app and take baby steps towards completing it.
