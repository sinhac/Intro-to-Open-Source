- Scientific Computation
 - Normally heavy lifting (computations)  is done by fortran, c, c++ 
 - Applications range from weather forecasting, medical application, image processing, weapon simulation, chip fabrication
 - Normally they will enable higher-level language wrappers like Python to enable rapid deployment.
 - Domain specific langauges -- orthogonal to ho overlaying a genric scripting language like Python or C++ Computing engines.
 - Domain-specific langauges for scientific computing R, Julia 

- Common tools used - matlab (simulink) - octave
 - finite element methods
 - large scale computing - paprallel computing, cuda, mpi 
 - languages used - fortran, c, c++
 - visualization (open source visualization toolkit vtk)
 - mathematica, maple - to do symbolic manipulation. LINPACK for during numerical computation
 - Linear Programming Package like cplex
 - Mathematics, Physics, Engineering
 - spice (network simulator) - vlsi design
 
- Python
  - pypy, mplotlib, cpython, numpy
  - lots of python packages
  - python notebook
  - arrays in python
  - networkx - graph/network manipulations
  - biopython ,
  
- Java 
 - cytopscape (systems biology)
